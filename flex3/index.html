        <h3>Vayne</h3>
        <p>The world is not always as civilized as people might think. There are still those who would follow the blackest paths of magic and become corrupted by the darker powers that flow through Runeterra. Shauna Vayne knows this fact well.</p>
        <p>As a young privileged girl in the heart of Demacia's elite, her father tried to convince her of the constabulary's ever-vigilant eye. Young and naive, she truly believed that her world was one of perfect safety, until one night, when a twisted witch took interest in her father. The malevolent woman overcame her father's conciliar guard, then tortured her family before murdering them. The young Shauna escaped only by hiding herself and then fleeing once the hag had departed, plagued by the screams of her loved ones as she ran. A burning hatred was born in her that day, one that could never be denied.</p>
        <p>Vayne was able to take care of herself using her father's money, and she began to train as soon as an instructor would have her as a student. By the time she was a fully grown woman, she had become a grim warrior. However, the fields of battle were not to be her home.
            <br>Demacia needed a protector, one who hunted those lost to the darkness. Shauna used her family's contacts to become the first Night Hunter, and now her prowess is legendary. It is said that those who practice the black arts quake when they hear that the Night Hunter is on the prowl.

        <h3>Thresh</h3>
        <p>Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is a restless spirit who prides himself on tormenting mortals and breaking them with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond the point of death, for Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his lantern to torture for all eternity.</p>
        <p>In an age history has all but forgotten, the man who would later be known as Thresh was once a member of an order devoted to gathering and protecting knowledge.</p>
        <p>The masters of this order tasked him with guarding a hidden underground vault filled with dangerous and corrupted magical artifacts. Thresh was incredibly strong-willed and methodical, which made him well-suited to such work.
            <br>
           The vault Thresh guarded was buried deep beneath the citadel at the center of an island chain and protected by runic sigils, arcane locks and potent wards. 
            <br>
            Spending such time in the presence of dark spells began to affect Thresh as the magic sought out his innate malice.

        <h3>Xerath</h3>
        <p>Powerful beyond reckoning, the Ascended being known as Xerath was once a mortal of flesh and blood. He is now something vastly different - a being of writhing arcane energy. Having emerged from millennia-spanning imprisonment, he is now ready to unleash his power upon Runeterra, and utterly destroy any who oppose him.</p>
        <p>Xerath ascends to his true form, becoming rooted in place and gaining 3/4/5 Arcane Barrages. This magic artillery deals 200/230/260 (+43% Ability Power) magic damage to all enemies hit.The root ends after 10 seconds, when all shots have been fired or when manually deactivated by issuing a move command. </p>
        <p>
            Popplio can snort out balloons made of water! Watch it spin water balloons into a playful battle strategy!
            <br>
If no barrages are fired, half of the cooldown is refunded.

        <h3>Pantheon</h3>
        <p>''Bring forth one true champion, or a hundred more like you, and then we shall have a battle that will be spoken of until the end of time.''</p>
        <p>The peerless warrior known as Pantheon is a nigh-unstoppable paragon of battle. </p>
        <p>
             He was born among the Rakkor, a warlike people living on the flanks of Mount Targon, and after climbing the mountain's treacherous peak and being deemed worthy, he was chosen to become the earthly incarnation of the celestial Aspect of War. Imbued with inhuman power, he relentlessly seeks the enemies of Targon, leaving only corpses in his wake.
            <br>
          Pantheon composes himself then leaps into the air to a target, striking all enemy units in an area. Enemies closer to the impact point take more damage.

        <h3>Sion</h3>
        <p>Who gave the order to halt? The underlings don't answer. No familiar faces. If I do not remember, neither will history.
</p>
        <p>A thousand shattered corpses lie at my feet, and Demacian homes burn all around me. It's over too quickly! Just one more...</p>
        <p>The men stare. There's fear in their eyes. If they're afraid to look upon victory, I should pluck those craven eyes out. There is no fear in the Grand General's eyes, only approval. He is pleased with this conquest.
            <br>
           Walking the field with the Grand General, surveying the carnage, I ache for another foe. He is hobbled, a leg wound from the battle? If it pains him, he does not show it. A true Noxian. I do not like his pet, though; it picks over the dead, having earned nothing. His war hounds were more fitting company.

        <h3>Kha'Zix</h3>
        <p>
A vicious Void predator, Kha'Zix infiltrated Valoran to devour the land's most promising creatures. With each kill he absorbs his prey's strength, evolving to grow more powerful. Kha'Zix hungers most to conquer and consume Rengar, the one beast he considers his equal.</p>
        <p>When Kha'Zix crossed over into this world, he was fragile and ravenous. The animals he first encountered were too small to fuel the rapid evolution he craved. Kha'Zix focused his hunger on the most dangerous creatures he could find, risking his life to satisfy his need.
            <br>
            With each kill he feasted and changed, becoming a stronger, faster predator. Kha'Zix soon chased his prey with unrestrained aggression, believing he was unstoppable. One day, while savoring a fresh kill, the predator became the prey. 
        </p>
        <p>
             From cover a creature pounced in a blur of fangs and steel, tackling him to the ground. 
            <br>
It roared in his face slashing and clawing, and Kha'Zix felt his blood spill for the first time. Screeching in fury, he sliced at the brute's eye driving it back.
